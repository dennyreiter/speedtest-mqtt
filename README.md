# speedtest-mqtt

Python script to run a speedtest using speedtest-cli and then publish the results as json to MQTT

Make your changes in the 'config.yaml' file.
It defaults to using 127.0.0.1 for the mqtt server and a dummy username and password. Adjust accordingly.
Otherwise the rest of the defaults should be fine.
